Information

This section does not form part of the General Asset License, but
must be included in any reproduction of the license.

The authors of the General Asset License do not provide legal services
or legal advice. Distribution of the General Asset License does not
create a lawyer-client or any other relationship. The General Asset
License is available "as is", and no warranty is given by its authors
regarding the license, any material licensed under its terms and
conditions, or any related information. The authors of the General
Asset License disclaim all liability for damages resulting from its
use to the fullest extent possible.

The General Asset License is intended as a general set of terms and
conditions that rights holders may use to share material subject
to copyright. Licensors should read and understand the terms and
conditions of the license before applying it. Licensors are solely
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using this license,
and assume any risks associated with the distribution of any work
under its terms and conditions.

Applying the General Asset License

To distribute a work under the terms of the GAL v.1.0, include the
notice available in Exhibit A of the license text in a prominent
location within each file. If it is not possible or desirable to
include the notice in a particular file, a separate file (such as
a LICENSE file) may be distributed prominently alongside the work,
containing the notice and clearly defining which files are subject
to this license.

Optionally, the attribution notice available in Exhibit B of the
license text may be included alongside the notice from Exhibit A,
thus requiring that the work be credited under use as per Section
3.4 of the license text.

You may also include any relevant notices of copyright ownership.

The distribution of the license text itself is not required for a
work to be licensed under the GAL, but is highly recommended in the
case of offline work.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, under no circumstances
and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for
